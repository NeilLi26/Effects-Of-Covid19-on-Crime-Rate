    "Before the pandemic, our teammate Neil has experienced no crimes more major than perhaps public drunkeness, but once the pandemic started, he has been subjected to two different attempts of grand theft auto and one shooting. This can't help but make us wonder: is this simply a streak of bad luck or is this the result of the pandemic?\n",
    "\n",
    "But it wasn't so simple, as research (Nivette et. al., 2021) has shown that crime rate decreases due to lockdowns forcing people to stay in their homes, there are also arguments to be had about how the economic downturn (Munywoki, 2020) could lead more people into commiting crimes for financial reasons.\n",

    "The result of this could have fascinating ramifications, and it could inform governments on the potential social benefits of providing stimulus cheques.\n",

    "Our hypothesis (research question) was: <b>Has Covid 19 affected the proportion of financially motivated crimes in Vancouver?<b>\n",
    "    \n",
    "The results were quite unexpected for us.\n",
    "    \n",
    "First, the visualization of bootstrapped sample has a normally distributed shape. Unless the bootstrapped plot is not normal, we could trust the bootstrap results. Since the distribution is easier to identify with more samples, our bootstrapped data has 1000 samples of replacements. The 95% CI is shaded blue in the plot, with the sample mean indicated as vertical red line. Our sample mean value of 0.06899849 represents the mean difference in proportion of crimes of Before and After COVID. The positive value sample mean indicates that there is an increase in crimes comparing \"After\" and \"Before\" crime rates. Negative value indicates the opposing result. However, as we could interpret from the distribution, there is only positive \"diff\" in crime rates from \"After\" and \"Before\". \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Before - After = +ve\n",
    "    \n",
    "Moreover, we have 95% confidence interval with lower CI of 0.0304651 and upper CI of 0.1075528. This implies 95% of our difference in proportion of \"Before\" and \"After\" lies between the lower and upper CI. Our data is 95% confident that there is a difference in proportion, hence we are 95% confident the crime rates decreased comparing \"Before\" and \"After\" COVID.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have calculated the p-value of 0.000439704868509851 from from calculating the proportions. The p-value tells us how likely our data could occur under our null hypothesis. Normally, a p-value of less than 0.05 is considered statistically significant, hence rejecting the null hypothesis. Since we have a much lower p-value than 0.05, we could have this as a statistical evidence to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Therefore, COVID 19 has not affected the proportion of financially motivated crimes in Vancouver to increase.\n",
    "    \n",
    "We had the research question from our personal experience of experiencing more frequent crimes during the pandemic. However, it turns out that statistically there is no increase in crime rates after the pandemic. The results were quite expected as we were expecting to see increased crimes after pandemic. \n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "Possible limitations: \n",
    "- Even though we classifed ourselves \"Breaking and Entering\" and \"Theft\" to be financially motivated crimes, the dataset does not tell us whether they are truly motivated by financial extortion.\n",
    "- We are missing data from 2022 November to December as \"After\" COVID when we started this research. However, it could still be doubtful whether 2022 November and December data would have significant effect on our results. \n",
    "- The boundary between \"Before\" and \"After\" the pandemic could be vague. There is no specific date or time to diverge the period of the pandemic. When is the exact start and end for COVID? There were times when COVID was definitely more severe, and when the bad things were alleviated. But it is not easy to clearly differentiate the years as \"Before\" and \"After\" COVID.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "Further questions:\n",
    "- Based on our possible limitations, we could focus more on crimes that involved financial activities to distinguish the real motive for the crimes. Perhaps, phishing scams, second-hand trading scams, or even financial fraud targetted to financially better off.\n",
    "- There could be a difference of crime rates where ecomonic downturn was harsher than Vancouver or not. Maybe the economic status could have been a more significant factor in handling the pandemic."
