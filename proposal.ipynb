    "\n",
    "Before the pandemic, our teammate Neil has experienced no crimes more major than perhaps public drunkeness, but once the pandemic started, he has been subjected to two different attempts of grand theft auto and one shooting. This can't help but make us wonder: is this simply a streak of bad luck or is this the result of the pandemic?\n",
    "\n",
    "But it wasn't so simple, as research (Nivette et. al., 2021) has shown that crime rate decreases due to lockdowns forcing people to stay in their homes, there are also arguments to be had about how the economic downturn (Munywoki, 2020) could lead more people into commiting crimes. So there are arguments for the pandemic leading people into commiting simultaneously less and more crimes.\n",

    "By comparing the distribution plots from bootstrapping and CLT, they are both unimodal and symetric. We also shaded the 95% confidence interval and indicated the mean with the red vertical line. In both processes, we used 95% confidence interval. It is for us to say we would be 95% certain that the distribution would contain the true mean. We have high confidence with the samples we generated, as their large sample sizes give us a narrower distribution.\n",

    "With the two preliminary distributions we've created, we could expect to reject the null hypothesis as the difference in $\\mu_1$ and $\\mu_2$ would not be 0. We hope to see more statistical evidence to reject the null hypothesis and adopt the alternate hypothesis. This is highly valuable information as it it provides some insight on the social consequences of the pandemic. Further research could be done to see how different kinds of crimes are affected by the pandemic."
