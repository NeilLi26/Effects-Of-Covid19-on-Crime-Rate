    "\n",
    "Before the pandemic, our teammate Neil has experienced no crimes more major than perhaps public drunkeness, but once the pandemic started, he has been subjected to two different attempts of grand theft auto and one shooting. This can't help but make us wonder: is this simply a streak of bad luck or is there a genuine correlation between these crimes and the pandemic?\n",
    "\n",
    "Now there are two ways to looking at this idea, as research (Nivette et. al., 2021) has shown that crime rate decreases due to lockdowns forcing people to stay in their homes, there are also arguments to be had about how the economic downturn (Munywoki, 2020) could lead more people into commiting crimes. So there are arguments for the pandemic leading people into commiting simultaneously less and more crimes.\n",
